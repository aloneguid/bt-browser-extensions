# "Browser Tamer" Browser Extensions

Send pages and links to another browser using [Browser Tamer](https://www.aloneguid.uk/projects/bt/).

Provides integration with Browser Tamer (a smarter default browser for Windows).

Quick access Browser Tamer via a button in the Chrome toolbar so you can send the page you are looking at to another browser.

Also adds a context menu item to links, so each link can be sent to Brower Tamer.

This repo contains source for both [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-tamer/oggcljknmiiomjekepdoindjcpnpglnd) and [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/browser-tamer/gofjagaghddmjloaecpnldjmjlplicin) extensions.

Firefox may be coming in the future.

Feel free to raise a PR for developing an extension.

P.S. Browser Tamer extensions are open-source, but Browser Tamer itself isn't. It's written in safe modern C++ and has some IP i'm not ready to share (yet).
